A new spin on the dated UI of the OPAC system typical of today's libraries.

* Users search for books using basic or advanced search.
* Borrowed books enter a cart for checkout or cancel (change of mind)
* Librarians have a separate login to check all borrowing records

## Built with
* Front end: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
